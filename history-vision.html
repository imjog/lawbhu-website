    <h3>History and Vision</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Banaras Hindu University is an internationally reputed temple of learning, situated in the holy
city of Varanasi. This Creative and innovative university was founded by the great nationalist
leader, Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, in 1916 with cooperation of great personalities like Dr
Annie Besant, who viewed it as the University of India. Banaras Hindu University was
created under the Parliamentary legislation - B.H.U. Act 1915.<br><br>
The Banaras Hindu University founded by Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji in
1916 is one of the most prestigious Central Universities in the country. The University was
conceived as a residential University, keeping in view its objective of complete character
development and thorough mentoring of students. Perhaps this is the only University in the
world where courses ranging from nursery and primary school upto Post Doctoral degrees are
taught and pursued within a walled campus spread over 550 Hectares (1360 acres) with
majestic buildings of great architectural delight.<br><br>
It was Mahamana&#39;s vision that this centre of life and light, will produce students who will not
only be intellectually equal to the best of their fellow students in other parts of the world, but
will also live a noble life, love their country and be loyal to the Supreme Ruler. He believed
that a teaching university would but half perform its function, if it does not seek to develop
the heart power of its scholars with the same solicitude with which it develops their brain
power. Hence this university has placed formation of character in youth as one of its principal
objects.<br><br>
BHU is ranked among the best universities of India in the field of research. Today, the
university is known for its state-of-art campus, environment, standard academic facilities,
values and culture. Being a part of this great and magnificent university, housing unparalleled
facilities and expertise of all kinds, the exposure and horizon of thinking of its students get
enhanced. Banaras Hindu University is virtually a microcosm of the Universe.<br><br>
<b>Dharmo Vishwasya Jagatah Pratistha</b> ( Dharma Sustains the Whole Universe ) is the motto
of Law School. The Law School of Banaras Hindu University which is one of India’s
leading Law Schools, situated in the holy and one of the oldest living city of Varanasi, or
Benaras, (also known as Kashi). Law school is situated on the banks of the holy river Ganga
and the City - known for spirituality, where life is obsessed with unending search for truth
and knowledge. Law school is one of the leading faculties of Banaras Hindu University. It is
the largest residential institution in Asia and holds third place in overall ranking of
universities of 2018 in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings
released by the HRD Ministry.<br><br>
The Banaras Law School should be a pioneer institution of legal education in India with an
excellent team of teachers and a selected students body, stressing individual attention and
extensive as well as intensive study and thereby carrying further the all important task of
educational renaissance in the country in a manner befitting the monumental efforts of the
founder of the University, Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya ji <b>- Prof. Anand Jee, &#39;Dean&#39;s
Report&#39;, (1965) 1 Banaras Law Journal 1, at 3.</b><br><br>

The Law School is one of the earliest Faculties established in the Banaras Hindu University.
Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, the founder of this university, served for many
years as Dean of Law School. The legal luminaries like Sir Ras Behari Ghosh and Sir Tej
Bahadur Sapru, were the earlier Deans.<br><br>
The Law School has been pioneer in introducing full time three year LL.B course of studies
and two year full time LL.M. programme. It has taken a lead and perhaps the only Law
School in India in introducing two years full time special courses of LL.M. in Human Rights
and Duties Educations. It is the first Law School in India to introduce clinical legal education
and legal aid program to cater the needs of the poor.<br><br>
The Banaras Law School was one of the Six Universities in India to start CLINICAL LEGAL
SERVICES. The model developed by Law School has been judged as the best model by
Hon’ble Mr. Justice P. N. Bhagwati, former Chief Justice of India.<br><br>
Law School has developed a holistic approach towards understanding law and justice from a
multi-disciplinary perspective. It offers various academic programmes to generate especially
skilled global legal professionals. Law School offers different and diverse courses in the field
of law and justice. For the purpose of admissions at undergraduate level, two different kinds
of LL.B. Courses are available. Banaras Hindu University conducts two Undergraduate
Entrance Tests (UET) during April / May in every year [BLAT in case of B.A. LL.B (Hons)
and UET for LL.B (Hons)]. Admissions are made according to merit of the entrance exam,
and fulfilling the eligibility requirements and availability of seats in respective courses. These
courses are :
<ul>
  <li>LL B (Hons) Duration: 6 Semesters (3 Years)</li>
  <li>BA LL B (Hons) Duration:10 Semesters (5 Years) (Under Special Courses of Study)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other courses available at Law School :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Courses For Master of Laws (Full Time)</li>
  <li>Course For Doctorate in Law (Full Time)</li>
  <li>Ph D (Full Time)</li>
  <li>One Year (Two-Semester) Post Graduate Diploma Courses (Part- Time)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to above comes a number of students are doing research work in the area like Law
of Taxation, Constitutional Law, Personal law, Intellectual Property Rights, International
Law and many more subjects. The Law school publishes a highly reclaimed law journal in
the country since 1965 on bi-annual basis. Eminent Indian and foreign scholars contribute
research papers for publication in the Banaras Law Journal. In order to promote scholarship
and research various issues of the Banaras Law Journal are available at law school school&#39;s
website on open access mode. To promote skill of advocacy and love for legal profession for
among the Law students, Moot Court Society is established in the Law School. Students of
law school participate in various national and international moot court competitions. We
conduct two intra law school moot court competition and a national event called Mahamana
Malaviya National Moot Court Competition.</p>

<p>Also, the Law School has taken a lead to introduce community oriented courses of law
introducing Law of Environment, Law and Country and Town Planning, Law and Poverty,
Law and Population, Animal Laws and many more which were unheard to most of the Law
colleges of India.</p>
<p><b>Our Assumptions:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>WE BELIEVE that Dharma sustains the whole universe, i.e. <i><b>Dharmo Vishwasya -
  Jagatah Pratistha.</b></i></li>
  <li>WE BELIEVE that Law Graduates have to play a significant role in <b>the preservation
  and promotion of the cherished values of the society</b> and in maintaining harmony
  in the society.</li>
  <li>WE BELIEVE that if <b>the concept of Rule of Law</b> is to be preserved and the law
  graduates are to play their roles as leaders in the society, we must provide a system of
  legal education that will not only produce man skilled in tailoring legal prescription to
  the needs of present day India and making the law a tool of social engineering.</li>
